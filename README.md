# MPM

MPM(**_Marix_** **_Parallel_** **_Multiplication_**) is a project in a very early stage.  
I learned a lot of things in my previous project [BSL6D](https://gitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de/bsl6d/bsl6d), so I think it's time to make my own formal project.  

## The tools I am going to use to multiply two matrices in parallel with C++: 

- OpenMP
- CMake
- JSON
- Google Test

```cpp
std::cout << " Welcome to my project!" << "\n" ; 
```

### What has been done so far? 
- [ ]  Creating the class. 
- [ ]  implementing the JSON file.
