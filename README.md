# MPM

MPM(**_Marix_** **_Parallel_** **_Multiplication_**) is a project in a very stage.  
I learnt a lot of things in my previous project [BSL6D](https://gitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de/bsl6d/bsl6d), so I think its time to make my own formal project.  

## The toold I am going to use to multiply two matrices in parllel with C++: 

- OpenMP
- CMake
- json
- Google Test

```cpp
std::cout << " Welcome to my project!" << "\n" ; 
```

### What have been done so far? 
- [ ]  Creating the class. 
- [ ]  implementing the json file.
